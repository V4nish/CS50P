# CS50P

This are my code files from the CS50P Live Recording 2022.

The source file names are mostly suffixed with a number to indicate progress through the class.  Little did I know that you can download these (with very similar iterations) from the CS50P web page!

A little bit of organising is needed before I convert the content to be more High School level, hopefully with basic lesson plans.  Oh, how we teachers have so much free time ;)
